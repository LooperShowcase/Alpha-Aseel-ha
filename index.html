      The horse (Equus caballus)[2][3] is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed
      mammal. It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two
      extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has evolved over the past 45
      to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, close to Eohippus,
      into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating
      horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is believed to have been
      widespread by 3000 BCE. Horses in the subspecies caballus are
      domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as
      feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, which are
      horses that never have been domesticated and historically linked to the
      megafauna category of species. There is an extensive, specialized
      vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything
      from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion,
      and behavior.
