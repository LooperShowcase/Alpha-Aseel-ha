      Grand National 2023: What is it and when does it take place? The Grand
      National 2023 is approaching on Saturday 15 April, following a week of
      horse-racing action at Aintree Racecourse, Merseyside. An iconic race
      which started in the 1800s, the Grand National marks the end of Aintree
      Festival with a handicap steeplechase over an official distance of about 4
      miles and 2.5 furlongs. Its controversy stems from the noticeably higher
      fences horses are forced to tackle, with the likes of Becher's Brook, The
      Chair and the Canal Turn, becoming notorious as a horse-and-rider test
      that can end fatally. Two horses died during the 2022 race. Sign up for

      The annual Cheltenham Festival starts today. It’s true that some people
      love the camaraderie and atmosphere of horse racing, and enjoy the chance
      to dress up. They don’t mean any harm to anyone or anything. But all the
      costumes in the world cannot mask the fact that Cheltenham is, in my
      opinion, exploiting animals and people alike. Racing folk love to tell us
      that they treat horses better than they treat humans. Well, in that case,
      don’t let them anywhere near your loved ones. Over the last 16 years,
      2,578 horses have died on British courses. These figures are on top of the
      horses that were sent to slaughterhouses when they became too old to race.
      A Panorama investigation in 2021 found that 4,000 former racehorses had
      been sent to slaughterhouses in Britain and Ireland since the beginning of
      2019. Sometimes, retired racehorses are driven to laboratories first so
      that scientists can perform cruel experiments on them before they’re
      killed. Remember this, next time a racing fan tells you that they love
      horses. Cheltenham is particularly deadly: 73 horses have been killed at
      the festival since 2000. In 2006 alone, 11 horses died there. A report
      from Animal Aid exploring why so many horses die at Cheltenham highlighted
      “crowded races, extreme race distances, novice horses used in demanding
      events, stiff (no-give) fences and challenging racing ground”. Let’s drop
      the fairytales: racehorses are not looked after. They are brutally
      exploited, while people – dressed up in ostentatious outfits – look on and
      drunkenly cheer. The use of animals in travelling circuses is banned in
      England, but the same exploitation continues every day on racecourses. And
      exploitation isn’t just limited to animals, but people too. Take gambling:
      last year, Paddy Power estimated that as much as £1 billion would be
      gambled on festival races. “There is no other meeting like it,” agreed a
      delighted spokesman from Coral. Let’s look at that. Addiction experts said
      at the weekend that they are braced for a surge in people seeking support
      for problem gambling after Cheltenham. Shouldn’t we be being more
      responsible? Then there is Cheltenham Ladies’ day, which you could say is
      an example of classism. The pressure is on for everyone to dress up in
      expensive (and noteworthy) outfits. Often, we find ourselves scrolling
      through galleries to spot the most ridiculous. Is that cruel or classy?
      Not to mention that it often seems like the costumes only perpetuate the
      impression that horse racing is an elitist sport. This is all before we
      get to the violence. In 2018, one racegoer nearly lost his sight in one
      eye after being punched in what he believed may have been a homophobic
      attack. The same year, a senior festival manager was hospitalised.
      Finally, and new for 2023, the local council is being forced to use
      “splash-back paint”, which causes liquid to return in the direction of its
      source, to try and discourage revellers from urinating publicly all over
      the town. Again, I can’t help feeling this is symbolic of the dark side of
      Cheltenham Festival, away from all the glitz and glam and air of
      celebration – one in which the horses, and many of those who walk away
      with empty pockets, suffer. No amount of splash-back paint can help with
      that.
