      Lifespan and life stages Depending on breed, management and environment,
      the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years.[7]
      Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally,
      beyond.[8] The oldest verifiable record was "Old Billy", a 19th-century
      horse that lived to the age of 62.[7] In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had
      been listed in Guinness World Records as the world's oldest living pony,
      died in 2007 at age 56.[9] Regardless of a horse or pony's actual birth
      date, for most competition purposes a year is added to its age each
      January 1 of each year in the Northern Hemisphere[7][10] and each August 1
      in the Southern Hemisphere.[11] The exception is in endurance riding,
      where the minimum age to compete is based on the animal's actual calendar
      age
